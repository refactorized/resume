This resume constitutes a minimal viable product of an eventually amazing webpage. Surely, as a resume for a seasoned 
engineer in the web development space, not just any webpage will suffice, but development time is in opposition to 
opportunity cost. Instead this plaintext document seeks to deliver 80% of that value in 20% of the time.

                                                   -[ Introduction ]-

I am a seasoned software engineer with experience over a broad variety of platforms and paradigms. I have provided 
technical leadership and innovation as an architect of multiple full-stack web solutions.  

My career spans nearly two decades of evolving trends and disciplines in the web development space. From CGI gateways to 
SPAs to JAM-Stack, I have seen the pendulum swing between client and server, UX and DX, semantic and presentational CSS. 
Throughout, I have been continuously impressed and inspired by the scope, complexity, and nuance inherent in developing 
software for the broadest possible audience.

I look forward to leveraging my learning thus far in new endeavors, whether they further my journey in web applications
engineering or turn towards new languages and opportunities in computer science. I am driven forward by a passion for 
craft and a desire to learn every day.
                      
                                                    -[ Character ]-

- I have loved programming since 7th Grade, when I learned BASIC from a math textbook and on an IBM 8088 (also I'm old)
- I have loved JavaScript since 2012, when I sat down with 'JavaScript, the Good Parts' to relearn the language
- I believe effective programming is a process of discovering the boundaries between innate and artificial complexity
- I believe that empathy, humility, and curiosity are as essential as knowledge, intelligence and experience
- I value diversity, equity, inclusivity and accessibility
- I vastly prefer solving difficult problems to completing repetitive tasks
- I really like bulleted lists (and parentheses)
