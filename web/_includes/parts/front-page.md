## Web Platform Practitioner

My career comprises over a decade of modern web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As web development has evolved from statically served pages, to client-heavy SPAs, to full-stack
hybrid client/server applications I have continuously broadened and deepened my skill set.

A problem solver first, my best work has been in creating solutions that boost developer
effectiveness, code reusability, and cross department collaboration.
